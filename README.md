Apryx Scripting Language

Welcome to a short description of ApryxScript. A typesafe Javascript inspired language that has been in development for quite a while now!

ApryxScript looks a lot like Javascript, the hello world program looks like this:
```
print("Hello World!")
```

As you can see, its very straight forward C like. You can declare variables like this:
```
var variableOne = 1
var variableTwo : int = 2
```

Some other examples that hopefully speak for themself (the readme file will become better later :) )

```
function main(){
  print("This is the main function")
}
main();
```
